# Optimized Pre-Processing for Discrimination Prevention

This repository provides code for our optimization-based pre-processing framework for reducing discrimination introduced in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03354" target="_blank">NIPS17</a> paper.

#### Dependencies 
1. [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy)
2. [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter)


#### Using the code

1. Jupyter Notebook for pre-processing the Adult dataset can be found in the directory "Adult".
2. Jupyter Notebook for pre-processing the Compas dataset can be found in the directory "Compas".

Please cite the corresponding paper when using the code.
